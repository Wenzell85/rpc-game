#PLAN 

    #Step 1. Pseudo 

    1. Create a function "getComputerChoice" which returns either Rock, Paper or Scissor.
    2. Test "getComputerChoice" function with console.log().
    3. Write a function: playRound() that plays a single round of the game.
        3.1 function above to take two parameters ie playerSelection and computerSelection.
            3.1.1 parameter of the playerSelection function to be case insensitive.
            3.1.2 use prompt() to get input from the player.
        3.2 function must return a string which declares a winner eg. "You lose! Paper beats Rock".
    4. Only playRound function prints on the console. All other functions return a      value.
    5. Write game() function which calls the playRound function 5 times and reports a winner at the end of the game. 
        5.1 Use a for(){} loops to play the 5 rounds.
        5.2 Report the winner via the console.log()
